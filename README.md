# Maze Solver (Using A* Algorithm)

Get lost in the fun with Maze Solving, a project written in Python Pygame that lets you create your own mazes and watch as they're solved in real time. This project uses the A* algorithm to find the optimal solution to the maze, ensuring a fast and efficient solving process.
Maze Solver is built using python with pygame library, using A* algorithm to find the shortest distance.

A* is an **informed search algorithm**, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost
